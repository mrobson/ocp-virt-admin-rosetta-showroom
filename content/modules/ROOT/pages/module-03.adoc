= Hot Plugging Resources

In this module, you will add a network interface (NIC) to a virtual machine. To do this, you will start with an existing VM that has a single NIC on the pod network. Using the OpenShift Virtualization console, you will modify the configuration of the VM to include an additional NIC on a new network. You complete the hot plug action by live-migrating the VM to another worker node.
